# Liver-Cirrhosis-Outcome-Prediction-
Liver Cirrhosis Prediction â€“ Analysis Stage

In this project, I analyzed the Mayo Clinic liver cirrhosis dataset to predict patient outcomes (Alive, Transplanted, or Dead).
The analysis stage involved:

1.Data cleaning and preprocessing

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3.Feature encoding and scaling

4.Training multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM)

5.Performance evaluation using classification metrics and confusion matrix

6.Feature importance visualization
